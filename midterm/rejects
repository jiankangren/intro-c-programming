Katy Carr, noted fictional student, wrote this program:

\input mean.tex

The program won't compile, though.  The compiler fails to produce an
executable program, and says:
\begin{verbatim}
mean.c: In function `main':
mean.c:10: `cur_input' undeclared (first use this function)
mean.c:10: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
mean.c:10: for each function it appears in.)
mean.c:11: `total' undeclared (first use this function)
mean.c:15: `mean' undeclared (first use this function)
\end{verbatim}

(For your information: The numbers after {\tt mean.c:} in each message
are line numbers.  An {\em identifier}\/ is a variable name.)
