\subsection{break}
\label{break}

The {\tt break} statement interrupts a loop prematurely.  It's easy to
use:  You just write {\tt break;}, and control immediately passes the the
statement following the end of the smallest enclosing {\tt while}, {\tt
do{\rm\ldots}while}, or {\tt for} statement.\footnote{{\tt break} also
breaks out of {\tt switch} statements, which we'll see in section
\ref{switch}.}
