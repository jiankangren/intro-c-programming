Your program will pick a random number between 1 and 100.  	____________
									    
Your program will remember this number but keep it secret.	____________
									    
Your program will prompt the user to guess a number between		    
1 and 100 until the user guesses your program's secret		____________
number.									    
									    
When the user guesses your program's secret number, the game		    
is over and your program will print an appropriate message	____________
which includes the number of guesses taken by the user.			    
									    
When the user enters an incorrect guess, your program will		    
print an appropriate message and will say whether the guess	____________
was too high or too low.						    
									    
You will provide a method by which the user can quit in the		    
middle of a game if he or she desires.  			____________
									    
You will inform the user of how this may be accomplished.	____________
									    
After each game, your program will prompt the user to input		    
whether he or she desires another game.				____________
									    
If not, your program will finish.				____________
									    
Otherwise, it will play again.  				____________
									    
The computer will choose a new random secret number for each		    
game.								____________
									    
Your program should not assume that the user will always		    
type what you expect; it must handle bogus inputs gracefully	____________
and discard garbage input.     	        			____________
									    
									    
Total for assignment-specific points.   			____________
