	Explain what the C declaration

		int foo;

	does.


1. It tells the COMPILER to:

1.   find enough space for an <int>,

1.   stores 0 in the space, as an int,

1.   remembers that future references to `foo' mean this space,

1.  and arrange that when data is read or written to the space reserved
    for `foo', it is read or written as an integer, and not as something
    else.
