0. What's your name?

Write a complete program which reads integers from the user, reporting
when the user enters an integer that he or she has already entered.
You program should quit when the user enters the number 0.

For example: (Indented lines represent user input; other lines are the
computer's output.)

\begin{flushleft}
\verb% Please enter a sequence of numbers, 0 to quit.% \\*
\verb%        23% \\*
\verb%        119% \\*
\verb%        5% \\*
\verb%        119% \\*
\verb% You entered that number already.% \\*
\verb%        17% \\*
\verb%        1776% \\*
\verb%        119% \\*
\verb% You entered that number already.% \\*
\verb%        23% \\*
\verb% You entered that number already.% \\*
\verb%        2001% \\*
\verb%        0% \\*
\verb% Done.% \\*
\end{flushleft}

Your program need not check for bogus inputs.  Your program must behave
correctly as long as the user enters 30 or fewer different numbers; I
will not penalize you for bad behavior when the user enters more than 30
different numbers.
